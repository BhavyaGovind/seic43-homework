          <h2>About</h2>
         <p>
           Jenn Schiffer is the Director of Community Engineering at Glitch, where she's responsible for supporting, growing and advocating for the friendliest community of coders. She hasn't won any awards (not mad).
         </p>
         <p>
            Jenn earned both a Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science from Montclair State University, then joining the department to work on undergraduate and graduate level curriculum, accreditation, and advising of hundreds of students. She's taught tech literacy to non-technical majors, web development fundamentals to graduate Computer Science students, and haters how to love.
         </p>
         <p>
            A proponent of open web technology and ethical data science, she left academia to work in the web development industry, first as senior engineer at the National Basketball Association, open web engineer at Bocoup, and then as Glitch's first Community Engineer. She's built software that runs the gamut from sports stats delivery and healthcare price crowdsourcing, to pixel art creation tools and databases helping doctors find the best cancer treatment for their patients.
         </p>
         <p>
            She has spoken all over the world at nearly 100 events about JavaScript, ethics, and art. Jenn is based in Jersey City, where she has organized the developer meetup JerseyScript and was a founding core team member of the current iteration of Code For Jersey City. She's an Emerging Philanthropist at the Women's Prison Association.

            <h3>Seminar @ Portland, Oregon</h3>
            <h4>Recorded in September 2016 at XOXO, an experimental festival celebrating independently produced art and technology.</h4>
            <p>Jersey City-based artist/engineer Jenn Schiffer makes art with code, teaches code with art, and open-source tools for playing with both. Her hilariously deadpan writing satirizes tech culture and programming tutorials, roping in clueless mansplainers for literally years after publication.</p>

            <h3>Seminar @ JSConf EU 2019</h3>
            <p>Most people connected to the Web are carrying JavaScript in their pocket without even knowing it, and those of us making tools for building with it are either unaware of or blissfully ignoring that population. While JavaScript’s pervasiveness grows, so is the gap in its literacy, and this is a gap we need to solve if we’re ever going to survive self-driving cars on the blockchain. Let’s talk about JavaScript, the tool, as opposed to JavaScript, the Oracle-run Twitter account.</p>
