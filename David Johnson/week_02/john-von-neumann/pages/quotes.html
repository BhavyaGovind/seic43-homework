    <main>
      <h3 class="quote">"You insist that there is something a machine cannot do. If you tell me precisely what it is a machine cannot do, then I can always make a machine which will do just that."</h3>
      <p class="quote">- John von Neumann</p>
      <h3 class="quote">"von Neumann would carry on a conversation with my 3-year-old son, and the two of them would talk as equals, and I sometimes wondered if he used the same principle when he talked to the rest of us.”</h3>
      <p class="quote">- Edward Teller</p>
      <h3 class="quote">"Young man, in mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them."</h3>
      <p class="quote">- John von Neumann</p>
      <h3 class="quote">"I have sometimes wondered whether a brain like von Neumann's does not indicate a species superior to that of man."</h3>
      <p class="quote">- Hans Bethe</p>
      <h3 class="quote">"If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is."</h3>
      <p class="quote">- John von Neumann</p>
      <h3 class="quote">"To gain a measure of von Neumann’s achievements, consider that had he lived a normal span of years, he would certainly have been a recipient of a Nobel Prize in economics. And if there were Nobel Prizes in computer science and mathematics, he would have been honored by these, too. So the writer of these letters should be thought of as a triple Nobel laureate or, possibly, a ​3 1⁄2-fold winner, for his work in physics, in particular, quantum mechanics"</h3>
      <p class="quote">- Petr Lax</p>
      <h3 class="quote">"You wake me up in the morning to tell me I'm right? Please wait until I'm wrong."</h3>
      <p class="quote">- John von Neumann</p>
