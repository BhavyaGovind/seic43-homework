            <h3>Early life and education</h3>
            <p>Born Roger Wilson, she was raised in Leeds, Yorkshire, by parents who were both teachers, her father specialising in
            English and her mother in physics. From 1975, she studied computer science and the Mathematical Tripos at Selwyn
            College, University of Cambridge  and was a member of their Microprocessor society. In an Easter break from
            university, Wilson designed a microcomputer with a MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor, inspired by the earlier MK14,
            which was used to electronically control feed for cows.</p>
            <h3>Personal life</h3>
            <p>Wilson underwent gender reassignment from male to female in 1994. She enjoys photography and is involved in a
            local theatre group, where she is in charge of costumes and set pieces and has acted in a number of productions. She has
            also played a cameo role as a pub landlady in the BBC television drama Micro Men, in which a younger Wilson is played by
            Stefan Butler.</p>
