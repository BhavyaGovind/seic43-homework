// Warmup - Raindrops
// Write a Javascript program that will take a number (eg 28 or 1755 or 9, etc) and output the following:
//
// If the number contains 3 as a factor, output 'Pling'.
// If the number contains 5 as a factor, output 'Plang'.
// If the number contains 7 as a factor, output 'Plong'.
// If the number does not contain 3, 5 or 7 as a factor, output the number as a string.
// Examples
// 28 has 7 as a factor.
// In raindrop-speak, this would be a simple "Plong".
// 1755 has 3 and 5 as factors.
// In raindrop-speak, this would be a "PlingPlang".
// 34 has neither 3, 5 nor 7 as a factor.
// Raindrop-speak doesn't know what to make of that, so it just goes with the straightforward "34".

// const findFactor = function (number) {
//   if (number % 3 === 0) {
//     console.log('Pling');
//   } else if (number % 5 === 0) {

//   } else if (number % 7 === 0) {
//     console.log('Plong')
//   } else {
//     console.log(`Raindrop-speak doesn't know what to make of that, so it just goes with the straightforward ${number}`);
//   }; // This won't work as only the first condition will be checked instead of the full code.
