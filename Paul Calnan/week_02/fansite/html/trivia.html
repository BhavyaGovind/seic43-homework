      <h3>Trivia</h3>
      <p>Donald Knuth pays a finder's fee of $2.56 for any typos/mistakes discovered in his books, because "256 pennies is one hexadecimal dollar".
      "Valuable suggestions" are worth 32 cents, or about ​1⁄8 of the errors in the book (0.2 hexadecimal dollars or 20 hexadecimal cents). In his earlier books a smaller reward was offered.(His bounty for errata in 3:16 Bible Texts Illuminated, is, however, $3.16).
      <br><br>
      Each check's memo field identifies the book and page number. 1.23 indicates an error on page 23 of Volume 1. (1.23) indicates a valuable suggestion on that page.
      <br><br>
      Initially, Knuth sent real, negotiable checks to recipients. He stopped doing so in October 2008 because of problems with check fraud. As a replacement, he started his own "Bank of San Serriffe", in the fictional nation of San Serriffe, which keeps an account for everyone who found an error since 2006.
      <br><br>
      Knuth now sends out "hexadecimal certificates" instead of negotiable checks.
      <br><br>
      As of October 2001, Knuth reported having written more than 2,000 checks, with an average value exceeding $8 per check.
      By March 2005, the total value of the checks signed by Knuth was over $20,000.
      Very few of these checks were actually cashed, even the largest ones. More often they have been framed and kept as "bragging rights".

      <br>
      <p>In addition to his writings on computer science, Knuth is also the author of "3:16 Bible Texts Illuminated", in which he attempts to examine the Bible by a process of "stratified random sampling," namely an analysis of chapter 3, verse 16 of each book. Each verse is accompanied by a rendering in calligraphic art, contributed by a group of calligraphers under the leadership of Hermann Zapf.
      </p>
      <p>Knuth published his first "scientific" article in a school magazine in 1957 under the title "Potrzebie System of Weights and Measures." In it, he defined the fundamental unit of length as the thickness of MAD magazine #26, and named the fundamental unit of force "whatmeworry". MAD magazine bought the article and published it in the June 1957 issue.
      </p>
      <p>Knuth's hobbies include music, and specifically playing the organ. He has a pipe organ installed in his home. Knuth disclaims any particular talent in the instrument, however.
      </p>
      <p>He does not use email, saying that he used it from about 1975 until January 1, 1990, and that was enough for one lifetime. He finds it more efficient to respond to correspondence in "batch mode", such as one day every three months, to be sent by postal mail.
      </p>
      <p>He is married to Jill Knuth, who published a book on liturgy titled 'Banner without Words', published by Resource Publications in 1986. They have two children.
