      <p><span class="dropcap">A</span>lan Turing , in full Alan Mathison Turing, British mathematician and logician, who made major contributions to mathematics, cryptanalysis, logic, philosophy and mathematical biology and also to the new areas later named computer science, cognitive science, artificial intelligence and artificial life.</p>
      <p>Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.</P>
